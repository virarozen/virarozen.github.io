How to Tie a Tie: 1. Start with the front of the tie around your neck, pulling it tight.
2. Cross the fabric over itself, and pull up on both ends of the tie to make a loop.
3. Hold on to the top end of the loop, and make another loop with the bottom end.
4. Put your left hand behind the top loop, and put your right hand in front of the bottom loop. Hold on to both loops together, and tuck them behind your back (or through your belt loops).
5. Pull the loops gently until they’re snug against each other.
6. Make sure that all four corners are pointing inwards towards your body, and tuck them under either side of your collarbone (or just beneath your shirt if you’re wearing a jacket).</p><h2 id=the-other-side---sterek-au-genderswap---youtube>The Other Side - (Sterek AU, Genderswap) - YouTube<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#the-other-side---sterek-au-genderswap---youtube>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OceCOzy4VGY/maxresdefault.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.2T_P7Rm9Mgb_ptbpLj9x-QHaEK&pid=15.1"' alt="The Other Side - (Sterek AU, Genderswap) - YouTube"><p><em>Source: youtube.com</em></p><blockquote><p>sterek side swap genderswap body teen transformation into boy forced wolf supernatural stiles hair kid styles.</p></blockquote><p>Stay organized: Keep your life organized and stress free by following good habits.
