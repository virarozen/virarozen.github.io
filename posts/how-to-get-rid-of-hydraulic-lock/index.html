If you can, try to keep your eyes closed and focus on your breath. If that’s too difficult, try focusing on a neutral object like the wall in front of you. Give yourself time to get used to the practice — it may take a few minutes before you start feeling any benefits. Carry over the practice from day to day — if you find yourself struggling to stick with it for one session, try setting aside some time for meditation every day instead. Keep in mind that meditation isn’t about achieving some perfect state of mind; it’s about exploring how you’re feeling right now, moment by moment. 1JZ Powered E36 BMW | Driftworks Forum Source: driftworks.com\ne36 1jz bmw powered driftworks.\nThe power of blogging communities Blogging communities are one of the most powerful tools a blogger can have.
