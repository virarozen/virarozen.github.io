Procrastination is a habit that can be extremely difficult to break. It often starts small, with an individual delaying completing a task for just a few minutes, but can quickly develop into a more chronic problem. There are several ways to deal with procrastination, but it takes time and patience to break the habit.
One approach is to set realistic expectations for yourself. Recognize that some tasks are simply harder than others and aren&rsquo;t worth postponing indefinitely. Make sure you have enough information available before starting a project so you don&rsquo;t get stuck in research paralysis. Set deadlines for yourself and stick to them; if you miss one, make sure to adjust your plan accordingly.</p><p>Another strategy is to break the task down into smaller parts.
