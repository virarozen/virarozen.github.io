This will help you determine what topics to cover and which angles to take on them.</p></li><li><p>Choose a niche that interests you and focus on covering topics related to that area. If you&rsquo;re interested in fashion, for example, make sure your blog covers fashion-related topics, not general lifestyle tips.</p></li><li><p>Come up with a catchy name for your blog and make sure it&rsquo;s easy to remember (and type!). People will search for your blog using keywords in addition to the name of the blog, so make sure those keywords are included in the title as well as any other branding elements (i.e., logo, header image).</p></li><li></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://virarozen.github.io/posts/how-to-keep-bugs-away-from-string-lights/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How To Keep Bugs Away From String Lights - How To Hang String Lights On Covered Patio</span></a>
