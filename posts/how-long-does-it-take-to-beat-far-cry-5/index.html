If you can, try to keep your eyes closed and focus on your breath. If that’s too difficult, try focusing on a neutral object like the wall in front of you.

Carry over the practice from day to day — if you find yourself struggling to stick with it for one session, try setting aside some time for meditation every day instead. Keep in mind that meditation isn’t about achieving some perfect state of mind; it’s about exploring how you’re feeling right now, moment by moment.
