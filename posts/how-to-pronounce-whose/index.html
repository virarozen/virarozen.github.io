Intermediates can take their game to the next level by learning more advanced techniques. By applying these tips, intermediates can improve their skills and play at a higher level.</p><ol><li><p>Start with basic shots.

This will help them develop consistency and improve their accuracy.</p></li><li><p>Aim for the middle of the ball. Too often intermediates aim too high or too low when hitting balls, which causes them to mishit or miss altogether. Instead, aim for the middle of the ball to create more consistent shots.</p></li><li><p>Use your wrists and hands correctly. Wrist positioning is key when playing tennis; if you position your wrists correctly, you’ll be able to hit harder shots with greater accuracy and power.</p></li></ol></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://virarozen.github.io/posts/how-to-pronounce-aoibheann/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>How To Pronounce Aoibheann - These Were The Top 100 Irish Girl Names Chosen In 2020</span></a>
