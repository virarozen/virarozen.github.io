How to be a better multitasker
Multitasking is one of the most important skills you can have. It allows you to do multiple things at once, which can save time and make your life easier. Here are some tips on how to be a better multitasker:</p><ol><li>Start by focusing on one task and then gradually add more. If you try to do too much at once, it will be difficult and frustrating to complete any of them.</li><li>Break tasks into smaller pieces if possible. This will make them more manageable and less overwhelming.</li><li>Try working in short bursts rather than continuous periods of work. This will help your prefrontal cortex (the part of your brain responsible for decision making) rest and recover between tasks, which will improve your productivity overall.</li><li></li></ol><h2 id=12-orisha-obatala-statue-yoruba-santeria-seven-powers--etsy>12 Orisha Obatala Statue Yoruba Santeria Seven Powers | Etsy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#12-orisha-obatala-statue-yoruba-santeria-seven-powers--etsy>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.etsystatic.com/11252292/r/il/147d7c/1448444130/il_794xN.1448444130_ezcl.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.NSYc_PFemPxCsbZ6PaLYIwHaJ4&pid=15.1"' alt="12 Orisha Obatala Statue Yoruba Santeria Seven Powers | Etsy"><p><em>Source: etsy.com</em></p><blockquote><p>obatala santeria yoruba orisha.</p></blockquote><p>What is this article about?
